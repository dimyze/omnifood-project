# omnifood-project
This project is a website built from scratch in advanced HTML5, CSS3 and JS for a fictitious company called "Omnifood." Omnifood aims to provide a smart-based 365-days-a-year food subscription tailored to the user's dietary needs, primarily for people who are unable to cook on a daily basis.
